# What does "C++" stand for?

"C++" is a programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language. The name "C++" was chosen because it represents an increment operator in programming languages, indicating that C++ is an extension of the C language.

Here's a breakdown of the name:

- **C:** The programming language C, which was developed by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s. C is a widely used and influential programming language known for its efficiency and close-to-the-hardware capabilities.

- **++:** The "++" symbol in programming languages is commonly used as an increment operator to increase the value of a variable by 1. For example, `x++` increments the value of `x` by 1. In the context of the name "C++", it signifies an evolution or extension of the C language.

Therefore, "C++" can be interpreted as "C plus one" or "C incremented", indicating that it builds upon and extends the capabilities of the C programming language. C++ introduces features such as object-oriented programming, classes, templates, and many other modern programming constructs while retaining compatibility with C code.
